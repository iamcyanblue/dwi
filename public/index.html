    <p>“We are witnessing the gradual disappearance of the post war British welfare state behind a webpage and an algorithm. In its place, a digital welfare state is emerging. The impact on the human rights of the most vulnerable in the UK will be immense.”<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <cite>Professor Philip Alston (2018), United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.<cite>

    <div id="intro"><p>What happens when decisions affecting human lives are made by machines? How about when the bodies in question are disabled? And how complicit are humans in systems that affect marginalised and disadvantaged people?</p>

    <p>The UK Government, is already developing AI systems<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> and partnering with a network of public organisations and private companies to develop technologies that detect fraud and expedite decision making. But what if those machinic decisions are incorrect? A significant number of deaths have already been recorded from  2013 to the present day<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>This project speculates on a near-future (2025) where eligibility for a disability benefit, <span class="emphasis">AbleFare</span>, is decided by an algorithm. You play in an online simulation of a future benefits infrastructure. You can choose to play in two roles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="stories.html" target="_self">Click here</a> to assume the persona of a disability benefit claimant, undergoing an online assessment conducted by the fictional <span class="emphasis">Department for Welfare Intelligence – DWi</span>.</li>
    <li><a href="ubiqio.html" target="_self">Click here</a> to play as an employee of a fictious, private corporation – <span class="emphasis">ubiq.io</span> – developing a ML model to detect deception, by analysing the speech patterns of benefit claimants.</li>
